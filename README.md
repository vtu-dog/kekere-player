- [Running the project](#running-the-project)
- [Additional info](#additional-info)

## Running the project
First off, you'll need to rename `.env_example` to `.env`. Populate it with an authentication token and a domain name that you'll be connecting to.

If you'd like to just run the app, use `$ yarn start`. If you'd rather create a package, run `yarn build-X`, where `X` is one of `mac`, `win`, `linux`.

## Additional info
The project was tested on macOS 12.6.0 Monterey (arm64).
